////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Thank you for purchasing the Grab That Gem Package.
All the effect prepab is made of only two materials(for Gems and for Particle Effects).
A PNG file with a detailed description is located in the path below.

    [VFX_Klaus -> Prefabs -> Grab That Gem]
        "Grab That Coin_How Does It Work (Gem) page.1"
        "Grab That Coin_How Does It Work (Gem) page.2"
        "Grab That Coin_How Does It Work (Particle)"

Material and shader named "VFX_lab" is not used for effects.
It was used in the background of Scene just to show the effect.

Thank you once again, and I hope my effect will be useful for your development.
